Dijkstra

To run the program, download the jar file and enter the following into the command prompt:
	java -jar \path\to\filename.jar  

The program will then prompt the user for an input data file. Enter the file path for your desired data file.
If no file path is entered, the program will use the data file provided with the assignment.

The program will then prompt the user for both a start and end vertex. Once given, Dijkstraï¿½s algorithm will execute.
The program both prints the results to the command prompt and saves the results to a text file listed underneath the results.
